#### Introduction
In this project, I use the **Canadian Large Fire Database (LFDB)** to explore the temporal and spatial distribution 
and association of landscape-scale fire in Canada. LFDB is a compilation of forest fire data from all Canadian agencies, 
including provinces, territories, and Parks Canada. For more information, please visit website of 
[Natural Resources Canada](http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/en_CA/lfdb)

#### How to replicate my analysis
* Creat four new folders on an empty directory with names shown below:
  * data
  * code
  * figure
  * results
* Download the following files into the empty directory (or folders):
  * Download raw data [LFD_A02_5999_e.txt](https://github.com/smilecat/stat545a-2013-hw06_hu-yum/blob/master/data/LFD_A02_5999_e.txt) 
into data folder
